# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the architecture of the multi-file repository project, detailing the design decisions, structure, and components of the application.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **src**: Contains the main application code.
  - **main.py**: The entry point of the Python application, orchestrating the execution flow.
  - **modules**: A package for organizing related functionalities.
  - **services**: Contains TypeScript modules that handle business logic and API interactions.
  - **utils**: A collection of utility functions that can be reused across the application.

- **tests**: Holds the test cases for the application.
  - **unit**: Contains unit tests for individual components.
  - **integration**: Contains integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the application.

- **docs**: Documentation files, including architecture and usage examples.

- **examples**: Provides sample usage guides for users.

- **scripts**: Contains scripts for setup and configuration tasks.

- **.github**: Contains configuration files for continuous integration workflows.

## Design Decisions
- The application is designed using a modular approach, allowing for separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
- Python is used for the main application logic, while TypeScript is utilized for service-related functionalities, leveraging the strengths of both languages.
- Testing is prioritized with a clear structure for unit and integration tests, ensuring reliability and robustness of the application.

## Conclusion
This architecture aims to provide a scalable and maintainable codebase, facilitating future enhancements and ease of use for developers and users alike.
